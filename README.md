# C Homework Repository

This repository contains my solutions to C homework assignments.

## Structure

The code is organized into directories:

*   `src/`: Contains all source code.
*   Each homework assignment has its own subdirectory (e.g., `Homework_1/`, `Homework_2/`).
*   Solutions are Python files within those subdirectories (e.g., `[task_1].py`, `[task_2].py`).
